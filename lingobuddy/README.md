# LingoBuddy

When someone clones your repository, to ensure everyone is on the same page with the development setup, they should have the following installed and follow certain commands to get started:

### Prerequisites

1. **Git**
2. **Node.js and npm**
3. **Docker**: Install Docker
5. **Clerk Account**: To be made

### Setup Commands

After cloning the repository, they should navigate into the project directory and perform the following steps for both frontend and backend setups:

1. **Frontend**:
   - Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd frontend/lingobuddy` (adjust the path if it's different).
   - Install dependencies: `npm install`.
   - Start the development server: `npm start` or `npm run dev` (if using custom scripts).
   - Ensure Tailwind CSS is set up if they intend to make changes to styles or if it's their first setup.

2. **Backend**:
   - Navigate to the backend directory: `cd backend/lingobuddy` (adjust the path if it's different).
   - Install dependencies: `npm install`.
   - Start the development server: `npm run dev` (assuming you're using Next.js for the backend).
